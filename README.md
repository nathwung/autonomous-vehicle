An autonomous vehicle developed in 24 hours at UTRA Hacks (University of Toronto Robotics Association), using an Arduino UNO, two motors, and a combination of infrared and ultrasonic sensors. The vehicle successfully completed mini challenges such as line following and obstacle avoidance, with real-time navigation logic implemented in the Arduino IDE.
